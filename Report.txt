3️⃣ Passwords Created and Tested

I created multiple passwords with different complexity levels and tested them using an online password strength checker.


---

🔹 Password 1: password123

Strength Score: Very Weak
Feedback:

Contains common word “password”

Contains only lowercase letters and numbers

Too predictable

Easily guessable


Analysis:
This password is vulnerable to dictionary attacks and brute force attacks. It is not secure.


---

🔹 Password 2: Lakshmi@123

Strength Score: Medium
Feedback:

Contains uppercase and lowercase letters

Contains numbers and symbol

Based on name (predictable)


Analysis:
Better than the first password, but still weak because it contains a personal name. Can be guessed through social engineering.


---

🔹 Password 3: Gk!9Lp#2xQ

Strength Score: Strong
Feedback:

Good length

Uses uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

No dictionary words

High randomness


Analysis:
This password is strong and resistant to brute force and dictionary attacks.


---

🔹 Password 4 (Passphrase):

BlueTiger!Runs@Night2026

Strength Score: Very Strong
Feedback:

Long length

Contains uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

Hard to guess

Not based on common phrases


Analysis:
Long passphrases are more secure because length significantly increases the time required for brute force attacks.


---

4️⃣ What Makes a Password Strong?

A strong password:

Is at least 12–16 characters long

Uses uppercase and lowercase letters

Includes numbers and symbols

Does not contain dictionary words

Is not based on personal information

Is unique for each account



---

5️⃣ Common Password Attacks

🔹 Brute Force Attack

An attacker tries every possible combination until the correct password is found.

🔹 Dictionary Attack

An attacker uses a list of common words and passwords to guess the password.

🔹 Credential Stuffing

Using leaked passwords from one website to access other accounts.


---

6️⃣ Why Password Length Is Important

Longer passwords:

Increase possible combinations

Take significantly more time to crack

Provide better protection against brute force attacks


Example:
An 8-character password is much easier to crack than a 16-character password.


---

7️⃣ What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?

Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring:

Something you know (password)

Something you have (OTP, mobile phone)

Something you are (biometrics)


Even if a password is compromised, MFA protects the account.


---

8️⃣ How Password Managers Help

Password managers:

Generate strong random passwords

Store passwords securely

Prevent reuse of passwords

Reduce human memory limitations



---

9️⃣ What Are Passphrases?

Passphrases are long combinations of random words that are easy to remember but hard to crack.

Example:
GreenApple!RiverSky2026

They are more secure because of increased length.


---

🔟 Best Practices Learned

Never reuse passwords

Avoid personal names and birthdates

Use at least 12–16 characters

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication

Use a password manager

Avoid common words



---

🎯 Conclusion

Through this task, I understood how password complexity and length directly affect security. Strong passwords significantly reduce the risk of brute force and dictionary attacks. Using passphrases and enabling MFA provides enhanced protection.
